Angular dependency injection is Hierarhical which means that if we inject a service into a child component without declariang it , the Angular will look up 
for the service declaration in the parent component and so on until the root component

@Self() The self decorator will ensure that we are not getting any service from up the component tree.
Ex: constructor(@Self private my-var: MyService)

On the other hand, if we want to make sure that we do get an instance of a service from further up
the application tree and.Not from the local component.We have the skip self decorator @SkipSelf().

We can also declare a service as optional with @Optional() decorator
